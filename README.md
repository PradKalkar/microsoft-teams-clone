<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/PradKalkar/microsoft-teams-clone)
<strong>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed a video chat application as the part of Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program, this application is destined to be the approximate clone of the famous Microsoft Teams software.
  </li>
  <li>
    A user must authenticate through any of the given identity providers (Microsoft, Google, Github, LinkedIn, Amazon) inorder to use the application.
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can connect to each other through video calls which offer a wide range of capabilities like microphone mute/unmute, video mute/unmute, screen sharing, leave call, copy meeting code and also inmeeting chat.
  </li>
  <li>
    The in-meeting chat is even persisted after the user leaves the meeting. So, if the user bychance forgets to note some things down when the meeting ends, he/she can also visit the chat section to see the respective meeting's chat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Meetings are safe, before joining an existing meeting, the user requires to take the permission of the meeting admin to enter into the meeting. The meeting admin gets a notification and accordingly can admit or deny entry.
  </li>
  <li>
    Users also have the option to chat with any other user separately or make groups, and moreover the chat is not just a text chat but the user can send any kind of information such as bold/italic/underline text, code part, embed a link, or send attachments. 
  </li>
  <li>
    We have popups for any invalid action - for eg entering an invalid meeting code in the "Enter a code" section of videochat, which clearly conveys the information to the user.
  </li>
  <li>
    We have popups for some actions which nicely and clearly conveys the information to the user - for eg entering an invalid meeting code in the "Enter a code" section of videochat or when copying the meeting code in the videocall, or when admitting a new person, or when waiting for the admin to let you in.
  </li>
  <li>
    We also have different sounds in the app, which make the overall user experience interactive. We have sounds for waiting, permission, joining a video call, receiving a chat message as well as error.
