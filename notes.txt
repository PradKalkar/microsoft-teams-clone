backend dependencies - socket.io, express
frontend - react-router-dom, simple-peer, styled-components, socket.io-client

WebRTC only designed for peer to peer communication
To facilitate a group video chat we will be making a mesh network
making peer for every possible connection
a single person will be having multiple peers for connecting to other participants
This approach wont scale much since we have to upload our stream to all the other users
which will take up a lot of bandwidth
Basic Idea in mesh network - 
1. Whenever I join a room, I send a signal(offer) to all others in the room.
2. They in return send their signals(answer) to me and handshake between all completes

The other ways for grp video chat can be mcu or sfu where we upload our stream only once
to the server. This approach is more scalable. peer to server communication 

Not Added video horizontal flip in css of styledvideo
Add this using this css for video - 
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
  -webkit-transform: rotateY(180deg); /* Safari and Chrome */
  -moz-transform: rotateY(180deg); /* Firefox */
